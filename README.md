## Overview 
I created a version of 2048 in which the user can select one of two color themes and has the option to resurrect after they die.

## Requirements
* OpenFrameworks version 0.10.1 or higher. Install OpenFrameworks by following the instructions at http://openframeworks.cc/download/ 

You will also need to add ofxGui to the project using OpenFrameworks. To do so, open OpenFrameworks' projectGenerator.exe, import this project, and select ofxGui under the drop-down menu in the Addons section.

## Installation
Steps:
1. git clone 
2. Open in Visual Studio (run as administrator) or a similar IDE through OpenFrameworks' projectGenerator.exe. 
3. Run.

## Code Style
I wrote this code in accordance with the Google C++ Style Guide (https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html). Note that methods required by OpenFrameworks deviate from this style.

## Demo
Below is a full demo of the Enhanced 2048 Game. Note that the user can change the tile theme and can resurrect after their first loss.
